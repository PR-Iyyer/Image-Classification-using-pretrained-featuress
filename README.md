Image classification using pre-trained vectors using stacked Autoencoder and classifying using CNN.


Image Classification on CIFAR-10 dataset. 

Objective: 

To design a network combining supervised and unsupervised architectures in one model to achieve a classification task on Cifar-10 dataset under the condition that only 50% of the following classes (birds, deer, truck) can be used for training.
Solution

Data Exploration.

This is performed for understanding the data. 
         
There are 50000 images of shape 32 x32 x 3  flattened its pixels and stored as 50000 x 3072.  Each class has 6000 images. The images can be visualised using plotting them.
